# Welcome to FPTU attendance application
We realize that taking attendance is time-consuming and causes disruption to the teaching and learning process of students and lecturers.
Here we propose a solution of using facial recognition application to apply for automatic attendance within the school.
Our application will bring convenience in the process of use and will help teaching and learning become more effective.

## 1. Application Overview
The application is built based on matchine learning algorithms.
Specifically, the algorithms used to build it are Haar cascade, PCA, SVM.
These are basic matchine learning algorithms that help build a face recognition model.
